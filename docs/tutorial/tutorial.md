# Tutorial

Vedro is a general-purpose testing framework suitable for a wide range of test types including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Despite its broad applicability, Vedro's true power is manifested in its ability to facilitate rigorous end-to-end testing. Hence, the primary focus of this tutorial will be writing end-to-end tests.

The tutorial is structured into a series of chapters, each addressing a distinct aspect of testing with Vedro. We recommend following the chapters in sequence for a smooth and comprehensive learning experience.

To begin your journey into the world of effective end-to-end testing, please start with [Chapter 1: First Steps](./api/chapter1-first-steps.md).
