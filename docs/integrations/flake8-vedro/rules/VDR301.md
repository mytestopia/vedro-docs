# VDR301. Steps name should be in right order

The Vedro framework categorizes steps into three types:

- “given” - arrange steps, preparing data,
- “when” - the main act,
- “then”, “and” and “but” - asserts

By their meaning steps should be ordered: preparing data after the main act or asserting something before the main act seems to be useless.


### ❌ Anti-pattern
```python
class Scenario(vedro.Scenario):
    subject = "scenario subject"

    def when(self):
        pass

    def and(self):
        pass

    def given(self):
        pass

    def then(self):
        pass
```


### ✅Best practice
```python
class Scenario(vedro.Scenario):
    subject = "scenario subject"
    
    def given(self):
        pass

    def when(self):
        pass

    def then(self):
        pass

    def and(self):
        pass
```
